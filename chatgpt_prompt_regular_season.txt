I need you to help me collect NCAA Men's Basketball REGULAR SEASON historical data (2015-2024) for backtesting a betting system.

**PRIORITY: REGULAR SEASON GAMES** (November through early March)
We need this NOW because regular season is currently happening!

For EACH season from 2015-16 through 2024-25, collect:

**Regular Season Games** (15-20 games per team):
- Date, Home Team, Away Team
- Final Score (Home, Away)
- Point Spread (closing line if available)
- Result vs Spread (home covered, away covered, push)
- Conference for each team (ACC, Big 12, Big Ten, SEC, Big East, etc.)
- Is it a conference game? (yes/no)
- Venue name
- TV coverage (ESPN, FS1, CBS, etc.)
- Rankings if available (AP Top 25)

**Focus Areas**:
1. **Conference games** (most predictable)
2. **Rivalry games** (Duke/UNC, Kansas/Missouri, etc.)
3. **Power 6 vs mid-major** matchups
4. **Weeknight games** (Tue/Wed)

**Data Sources**:
1. Sports-Reference.com/cbb (best for scores)
2. ESPN college basketball schedule/results
3. TeamRankings.com (good for spreads)
4. Covers.com or SportsBookReview (historical lines)

**Output Format**:
```json
{
  "season": "2024-25",
  "regular_season_games": [
    {
      "date": "2024-11-19",
      "home_team": "Duke",
      "away_team": "Arizona",
      "home_score": 69,
      "away_score": 55,
      "winner": "home",
      "margin": 14,
      "spread": -7.5,
      "spread_result": "home",
      "home_conference": "ACC",
      "away_conference": "Big 12",
      "is_conference_game": false,
      "venue": "Cameron Indoor Stadium",
      "tv_coverage": "ESPN",
      "home_ranking": 4,
      "away_ranking": 14
    }
  ]
}
```

**Priorities**:
1. Start with **2024-25 current season** (games already played)
2. Then **2023-24 full regular season**
3. Work backwards to 2015-16

**Target**: ~5,000-7,000 regular season games across 10 years

March Madness can wait - we need regular season data NOW!
